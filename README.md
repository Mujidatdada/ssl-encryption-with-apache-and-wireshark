# ssl-encryption-with-apache-and-wireshark
This project demonstrates how to configure SSL/TLS on an Apache web server using a self-signed certificate to secure a sample login page (altschool-login.html). It also includes packet capture and analysis using Wireshark to show the difference in data transmission before and after encryption.
